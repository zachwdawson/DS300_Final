# DS300_Final

In this project a team of classmates and I took an online dataset of human genetic reads that are 50bp 
long and attempted to predict whether the read is a splice junction or not. If the read was a splice 
junction we aalso predicted whether it was an intron/extron junction or an extron/intron junction. We cleaned
the data and extracted features from it in order to train a classification model.
We tested and tuned many types of classification models and found that various Naive Bayes implementations
worked very well for this task and were able to create a model that worked very well.

Relevant Technologies: Jupyter Notebook, pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and plotly.
